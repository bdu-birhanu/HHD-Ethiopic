## Historical handwritten Ethiopic script recogntion

This implementation is based on MMOCR, an open-source toolbox comprising various OCR-related models, such as text detection, text recognition, and key information extraction. For installation details and related information, please visit https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr.

In this directory, the CRNN, SVTR, ASTER, and ABINet models have already been configured for the Ethiopic script. If you are interested in training other models, you should follow the same configuration steps.
